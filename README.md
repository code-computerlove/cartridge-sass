This module requires node version 4.4.x at a minimum.

```sh
npm install cartridge-sass --save-dev
```

```shell
npm uninstall cartridge-sass --save-dev
```

## Dependencies

This module adds the following to a project:

* Sass compilation using [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass)
* Source map generation using [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps) (`local only`)
* Sass import file creation using [gulp-sass-generate-contents](https://github.com/andrewbrandwood/gulp-sass-generate-contents)
* CSS manipulation using [gulp-postcss](https://github.com/postcss/gulp-postcss)
* Automatic CSS vender prefixes using [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
* Media query merging using [css-mqpacker](https://github.com/hail2u/node-css-mqpacker)
* CSS minification using [cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/cssnano) (`--prod flag only`)
* Conversion of pixels to rems using [postcss-pxtorem](https://github.com/cuth/postcss-pxtorem)

## Config

Once installed, the config file `task.sass.js` is created and stored in the `_config` directory in the root of your cartridge project.
PostCSS plugins are loaded via `task.sass.js` this allows you to add further plugins that may be of use to the project. General configuration is added to `postCssConfig` settings placed here will apply to all uses of PostCSS. Additionally file specific settings can be added to `postCssTaskConfig`, these should be named as per the `taskConfig.files` configuration section.

The following settings are configured by default:

### autoprefixer
Configuration for [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is set on this property. By default we set the browsers option to browsers with more than 5% usage.

```javascript
{
	autoprefixer: {
		browsers: ['>5%']
	}
}
```
For more options see the [autoprefixer options](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#options)

## Usage

The [FrontEnd CSS guidelines](https://github.com/code-computerlove/frontend-guidelines/blob/master/FE-guidelines-CSS.md) are a good place to start when beginning your project

## Development
Please follow the instructions within the [base module development guide](https://github.com/cartridge/base-module/wiki/Development-guide) when working on this project.

### Branches
New work should be commited to the `develop` branch and then merged in to master once complete. Documentation changes can be performed on the master branch.

### Semantic Release
In addition to the base module guide, this project uses Semantic release to manage releases to NPM. When making changes and following the required commit message format releases are managed for you.

When the commit passes tests on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/cartridge/cartridge-sass) a new version will be published based on the content of the commits since the last release. For more information please see the [Semantic release project on GitHub](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

### Gold master
The project uses gold master files to determine if the generated CSS changes after updates to the module. If you are adding new PostCSS plugins or modifying versions then expect that this could change. Verify that the new CSS is correct and then update the gold masters.

#### Updating Gold masters
Once you have verified that the change to the CSS is appropriate the gold masters can be updated with the following NPM scripts:
* `npm run regengold:dev` Generates a new gold master for the dev environment
* `npm run regengold:prod` Generates a new gold master for the production environment

### Plato
The project has [Plato](https://github.com/es-analysis/plato) configured to generate reports on the Javascript complexity of the project. You can run the report locally with `npm run report`. This will run Plato and open a browser tab with the generated report. If you wish to simply generate the report use `npm run report-complexity`.
